# FirstRepo 
This my first repo to learn how to use it

The readme must contains the following fundamental information

1. A title
2. A description of the technology and why
3. A description of the process and why
4. A table of content

The Readme file use Markdown syntax.

Good practice also documents :

How the project came about 
The motivation 
The limitation
The challenges
What problem it hopes to solve
What the intended use is
Credits if things are used from other sources
